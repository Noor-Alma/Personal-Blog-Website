            <h3>Pithon language</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Python "is a relatively new programming language, first introduced in 1989, that has surged in
                    popularity
                    with
                    the
                    emergence of new fields of application. It is an interpreted language that supports automatic memory
                    management and
                    object-oriented programming. It heavily prioritizes developer experience."</p>

            <h3>C language</h3>

            <blockquote>
                <p>C "is still very popular due to its use in systems development, including operating systems, embedded
                    devices,
                    and as
                    firmware. The C standard library has been ported to many platforms, so it is viable in many use
                    cases.
                    However, the
                    low-level systems programming it is typically used for is a more specialized skill than general
                    application
                    programming.
                    This explains why C tends to have relatively few job openings as compared to other languages in the
                    top
                    10."

            <h3>C++ language</h3>
            <blockquote>

                <p>C++ "occupies a similar area in the market to C, including systems programming and low-level hardware
                    development. Over
                    the years, the C++ standard libraries and specifications have been expanded considerably, leading to
                    criticism that it
                    has become overcomplicated and difficult to learn."</p>

            <h3> Java language</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Java "is the leading general-purpose application development language and framework. It was
                    introduced in
                    1991
                    by Sun
                    Microsystems as a high-level, compiled, memory-managed language."</p>

            <h3>C#</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>C# "is popular for local and web application programming, often (but not necessarily) in systems
                    developed
                    primarily
                    based on Microsoft technology. Microsofts Xamarin framework allows developers to write Android and
                    iOS
                    applications in
                    C#. It is suitable for systems programming in some cases, and has libraries available for embedded
                    systems."
